# üìä Quantitative Finance Research Implementations

This repository contains my implementations and backtesting efforts for a growing collection of quantitative finance research papers. Each paper is implemented from scratch or restructured using Python, with a strong focus on reproducibility, clarity, and educational value.

The goals of this project are:

- To deepen my understanding of mathematical models and methods used in quantitative finance  
- To validate and extend existing research through code  
- To share practical, readable implementations for students, researchers, and practitioners

## üìö Papers Implemented

### 1. **Empirical Analysis of Value at Risk (VaR) of Stock Portfolio Based on Python**  
**Author**: Shengyuan Lu  
**Description**: This paper examines Value at Risk (VaR) for equity portfolios using Python. I‚Äôve replicated the parametric, historical simulation, and Monte Carlo methods for VaR estimation. Comparative analysis and visualization are included.  
**Keywords**: VaR, Monte Carlo Simulation, Risk Management, Portfolio Analysis

### 2. **Arbitrage-Free Smoothing of the Implied Volatility Surface**  
**Author**: Matthias Fengler  
**Description**: The paper introduces a non-parametric arbitrage-free approach for estimating the implied volatility surface using constrained smoothing techniques. I‚Äôve implemented a natural cubic spline smoothing algorithm with no-arbitrage constraints from scratch, along with IV surface construction.  
**Keywords**: Implied Volatility, Spline Smoothing, No-Arbitrage Conditions, Derivatives Pricing
